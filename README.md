## Abstract
Epidemic which crashes in 2020 is unpredictable and brings a huge impact globally. However, the spread of virus has been eventually affected human being continuously throughout the decades, for example SARS, Ebola and more. Nevertheless, as the virus are new to the environment which affect us all in sudden without any preparation, the only way we could to is to fight with time and mutation of virus. Of course, movement control order could help in decreasing the number of infection and transmission, however, this is a trade-off in dealing with viruses as this would highly affect the economic growth of the country especially the income of the ordinary folks. Thus, prediction in probability of infected area plays an important role so that government could make a more precise decision in fighting against the viruses. In this project, parts of SEIR model are used together with moving average and rate of change to observe the trend of epidemic and prediction in which area has the higher infection risk. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to determine the accuracy of the model. The project is developed using the package streamlit and employs some data mining rules for certain processes.
